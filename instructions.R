#questions to ask for linear regression 

#Start by examining the data to check for problems

#Plot the data before fitting models

#Plot the data to look for multivariate outliers, non-linear relationships etc.

#scatter plot of expense vs csat

## Exercise: least squares regression
## ────────────────────────────────────────

##   Use the /states.rds/ data set. Fit a model predicting energy consumed
##   per capita (energy) from the percentage of residents living in
##   metropolitan areas (metro). Be sure to
##   1. Examine/plot the data before fitting the model
##   2. Print and interpret the model `summary'
##   3. `plot' the model to look for deviations from modeling assumptions

##   Select one or more additional predictors to add to your model and
##   repeat steps 1-3. Is this model significantly better than the model
##   with /metro/ as the only predictor?


#------------------------------------------------------------------

##   Interactions allow us assess the extent to which the association
##   between one predictor and the outcome depends on a second predictor.
##   For example: Does the association between expense and SAT scores
##   depend on the median income in the state?

## Exercise: interactions and factors
## ────────────────────────────────────────

##   Use the states data set.

##   1. Add on to the regression equation that you created in exercise 1 by
##      generating an interaction term and testing the interaction.

##   2. Try adding region to the model. Are there significant differences
##      across the four regions?
